      			<h3>What's our Story?</h3>
      				<h4>Dr. Alan Care has worked as a GP for 15 years in our general practice of 20 doctors.
      				 For many years he has raised concerns at medical and political forums that
      				  the current paper based system for prescribing medication is susceptible to errors,
      				 for example the prescription script may be illegible to the pharmacist
      				  or critical information may be missed at accident and emergencies 
      				  if a patient inadvertently fails to remember all relevant information . 
      				  He has also noted that findings of medical research into chronic disease
      				   consistently highlights that a significant percentage of patients 
      				   with chronic disease lack knowledge of when and how to take the prescribed medication. </h4>
